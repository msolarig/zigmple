Projects currently available:

1. **Arithmetic Calculator** (supports user interaction to sum, subtract, multiply, and divide any two numbers)
2. **Time Display** (running idle display of date & time, only in UTC for now)

This projects were created as a way to learn some core Zig syntax and features, they can also be used as a guide to structuring simple ideas.
